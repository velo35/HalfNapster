# HalfNapster

A macOS app that exports the playlists in a users Napster library. Uses SwiftUI for the user interface and [OAuthSwift](https://github.com/OAuthSwift/OAuthSwift) to communicate with the [Napster's REST](https://developer.prod.napster.com/api/v2.2) api. User authentication is handled using the implicit auth flow. This app allows me to save and archive my Napster playlists for backup and also to assist me in replicating the playlists in other music streaming platforms.
